# AGENTS.md - AurenWorks Studio (guidelines for AI agents & contributors)

## Mission

aurenworks-studio is the builder UI. It must stay fast, accessible, and contract-first (consume OpenAPI/JSON-Schemas from aurenworks-schemas).

## Non-negotiables

- No secrets checked in. Use .env.local; never commit it.
- Typed API calls only via the generated client (or @aurenworks/client once published).
- Validation with zod (client-side) consistent with server schemas.
- Accessibility: use Radix/shadcn primitives; keyboard navigation must work.
- Performance: paginate/virtualize large tables; avoid N+1 requests.

## Architecture

- React + Vite + TS with Tailwind and shadcn/ui (Radix primitives).
- React Query for server state (caching, retries, invalidation).
- RHF + zod for forms; show inline errors, keep forms optimistic when safe.
- Monaco for YAML editing; show live validation messages.
- API client: openapi-fetch with types generated by openapi-typescript.

## Code style

- Functional components only; hooks for side-effects.
- Prefer composition over context; if global client state is needed, use a thin Zustand store.
- No any or implicit any; enable strict TypeScript.
- Keep components small; colocate feature code under src/features/\*.

## PR checklist

- Screenshots or short screencast for UI changes.
- Tests: at least one happy-path render for new views; hook tests for data loaders.
- Lint/format pass; pnpm client:gen run in CI before build.
- If adding an API call: centralize in lib/api/\* and use the typed client.

## Security

- Auth token is read from a single helper (authHeader()); never duplicate logic.
- Do not log sensitive values. Scrub errors before showing toasts.
- CORS/base URL must be configurable via env.

## DX tasks (good first issues)

- CLI to regenerate client types on file-watch.
- Sample Storybook stories for core components.
- Simple error boundary + toast system.
